This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially within a component that is rendered before the layout is fully determined.  It results in inaccurate or undefined dimensions initially.  The problem is that the `Dimensions` API updates asynchronously, meaning the initial value might be wrong. Accessing dimensions before they're available leads to unexpected behavior.
